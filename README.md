# crc-organoid-scrnaseq

Bachelor thesis project focused on the application of single-cell RNA-seq analysis
to improve the efficiency of colorectal cancer organoid cultures.

Project overview
This repository contains an exploratory scRNA-seq analysis workflow applied to
colorectal cancer organoid data.  
The goal of the project is to characterize cellular composition and signaling
features of organoid cultures using transcriptomic data.

The project is conducted as part of a Bachelor thesis in bioinformatics.

Dataset
- scRNA-seq dataset: GSE178341
- Data are not included in this repository
- Publicly available via GEO

Analysis workflow
The current version of the repository includes the following analysis steps:

1. Quality control, filtering of scRNA-seq data and marjer gene identification
2. Dimensionality reduction and embedding (UMAP)
3. Preparation of data for cell–cell communication analysis (CellChat)

Project status
Work in progress.  
The repository reflects an intermediate stage of the Bachelor thesis project and
will be extended with additional analyses.
